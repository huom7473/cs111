Notes:
The spec mentions receiving SIGPIPE as a result of trying to write to the shell
input pipe as an expected way to terminate. However, in reality, it seems unlikely
that there will be text in the keyboard buffer at the same moment the shell exits,
so at least with my implementation, it doesn't seem likely that this happens. Nevertheless,
I arranged for the SIGPIPE signal to just be ignored, since it doesn't have to be
explicitly checked for - poll() will report a POLLHUP if the shell's write end was
closed, which will cause my program to exit normally anyway.
