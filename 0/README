Smoke test cases:
no arguments: ./lab0 - inputs a test string to the program's stdin and checks that there's
no errors and stdout is the same as the test string

segfault: ./lab0 --segfault - checks that the program was terminated by a SIGSEGV
signal

catch: ./lab0 --catch --segfault - checks that program exits with return code 4 and prints
message to stderr

redirect: ./lab0 --input input.txt --output out.txt - generates a test input file, makes
sure output file contents are the same after termination, cleans up test files

file error: ./lab0 --input bogus - checks that the program exits with return code 2 after
printing an error message to stderr

argument error: ./lab0 --bogus - checks that the program exits with return code 1 after
printing an error message to stderr
