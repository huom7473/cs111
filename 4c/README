>>>>INCLUDED FILES<<<<

The following files have been included as part of the spec's requirements:

lab4c.c:
The C source module that is compiled by make (default) into the both
executables lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls. The protocol is determined at
runtime using the executable name.

Makefile:
Simple Makefile supporting default, clean, dist targets as mandated
by spec. Intended to be run on Beaglebone with libmraa and libssl installed.
Since both executables are compiled from the same source file, the default
option simply compiles the tcp version and makes a hardlink to it to
avoid having to compile twice.

README:
this README file.

>>>>NOTES<<<<
Important: the program often doesn't run properly unless it's run as superuser; it seems that
it needs higher permissions to correctly initialize/access the sensors. I have an error message
print out if it detects initialization failure. This was mentioned in the discussion section, so
I assume it's normal behavior and will be accounted for while testing.

I had a bunch of implementation notes on project 4b, which all apply here; since I passed
the test cases in 4b, they probably aren't relevant.

Note on ping:
Sometimes the server log and client log have slightly different ordering of lines.
For example, there might be an OFF command and an immediate shutdown on the client log,
whereas on the server log there is another temperature report before the shutdown line.
I assume this is because it takes time for the server to receive/process messages 
(mainly network latency, probably), whereas the client logs any sent messages instantly.
It didn't seem to be a problem for the sanity check.

Note on certificates:
The spec mentions certificates once, and there's a certificate file in the project
documents, but the spec didn't mention actually having to do anything with it. Also, 
on Piazza @602, it was confirmed that we don't have to implement anything for the
certificate, so I didn't. The sanity check also passes.
